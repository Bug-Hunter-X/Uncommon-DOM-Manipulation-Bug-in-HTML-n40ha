# Uncommon DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to DOM manipulation in HTML and JavaScript.  The bug occurs because the script attempts to modify elements or append elements that haven't yet been fully parsed and added to the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a script that tries to modify the innerHTML of a div and appends another div before the elements fully exist in the DOM. This leads to errors or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates the corrected approach.  This corrected version ensures that all necessary DOM elements exist before manipulating them. This could involve using event listeners or deferring the execution of the Javascript code to ensure the DOM is ready.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or errors in the browser's console.
